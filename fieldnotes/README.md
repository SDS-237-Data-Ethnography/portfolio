# Field Journal Assignment 

> At least 4 field journals should be completed by their respective due dates.

## About

Ethnographers keep field journals to thickly document what they observe in social environments. Typically field notes will describe a physical environment and the participants in that environment (including appearances, roles, behaviors, moods, interactions, conversations, etc.). Field notes will also interpret what was observed, considering how the empirical material affirms, contests, or transforms how we understand cultural phenomena. In data ethnography, the social environment under consideration can be anywhere data is produced, applied, presented, or talked about. This assignment is about paying attention to the numbers (and other forms of data) that inhabit daily life and practicing cultural interpretation.

## Learning Objectives

* Recall, define, explain, apply, and synthesize course concepts and ideas
* Engage the genre and practice of thick description
* Develop observational habits in data-saturated environments
* Develop skill in interpreting cultural meaning

## Instructions

1. Consider a statistic, dataset, data standard, or data collection environment that you encountered **in the past two weeks**.
2. Fill out the metadata for your data observation under the appropriate heading in the `field-journal.Rmd` document in this directory. Where and when did you observe the statistic, dataset, data standard, or data collection environment?
3. Write 300-400 words, first, detailing the environment and the people involved and second, interpreting its meaning. In your write-up you should consider the following question: *What socio-cultural forces are at play in shaping this statistic, dataset, data standard, or data collection environment?*
4. Reference and define at least one concept from our course's *Knowledge and Understanding* learning dimension. While our course concepts will be relevant to a number of environments, be sure to write about the dimensions of an environment where data are playing an immediate role. Be sure to use Markdown syntax to **bold** the *Knowledge and Understanding* concept you engage in your write-up.
5. Complete the checklist in `field-journal.Rmd` to make sure that you completed all parts of the assignment.

Note: If you wish to add images to your write-up, you may include them in the img folder and then reference them directly through R Markdown. 

## Other Guiding Prompts

If you are struggling to identify a statistic, dataset, data standard, or data collection environment, you might consider the following prompts:

* Observe a moment when you or someone you know has had to translate something complex into quantities. What was that like? What does it mean for the data?
* Observe a moment when a data infrastructure broke down. Maybe it’s a package that didn’t allow you to do something, a classification system that couldn’t account for something, or a server that crashed. What invisible work, politics, values, design decisions were revealed in this moment of breakdown, and what might this tell us about data that gets produced from those infrastructures?
* Observe yourself or someone you know engaging in data labor. How is that labor recognized and valued? How do people approach and care for their work? What does this mean for the data produced?
* Observe an instance where individuals were incentivized to act or communicate in a certain way in order to hit certain data benchmarks? How were data and human behaviors co-produced in these settings?
* Observe a conversation where folks are debating or calling into question what counts as credible data, data expertise, knowledge, etc. What boundary work is happening in this conversation? How does this boundary work impact what we perceive from data, how data is considered credible, and the trust we place in it?
* Observe a data collection practice. What rituals did the data collectors seem to adopt? What bodily senses did the data collectors engage? How does this impact the data produced?
* Observe a a talk, a news article, a scientific paper, or other media where data is introduced and discussed. What binary oppositions structure the way data is talked about in this media? How does framing data in these terms impact how we view data as a society?

## Rubric

When I read through your fieldnotes, I'm going to be thinking through the and commenting on the following questions:

| Criteria                                                                                                                | Area for Improvement | Good | Exceptional |
|------------------------------|----------------------|------|-------------|
| Student set the scene by curating relevant details in their description. All metadata was filled out.                   |                      |      |             |
| Student reflected on their own standpoint in the write-up.                                                              |                      |      |             |
| Student effectively explained and applied a key course concept.                                                         |                      |      |             |
| Student developed an argument regarding the cultural meaning of a data representation, infrastructure, and/or practice. |                      |      |             |
| Student exhibited experimentation in their writing (e.g. documenting sensory experiences; playing with narrative form).      |                      |      |             |
